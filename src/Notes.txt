Looking through the last lab we did and relying heavily on it 
Also looking at notes from last time I did this, but I didn't understand it then so it wasn't much help. 

I have a note that says I need to figure out how to map the bird something onto the ends in BirdLayout.

I also have something that says {birdData.map ((birds) => {
    return (
        <BirdLayout birds={birdData}/>
    )
})}
<Cart />

More code in my notes:
Bird({bird, updateCart})


It said we didn't need to format it but I remember it was hard to look at otherwise. 

IF I am setting cart content in handleAdopt, where is the state and where/what are the props?

what did I mean by "Calling a ffunction inside of child that will update things inside of the parent?
